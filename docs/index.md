# RSS + Steampipe

[RSS Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) and [Atom Feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) content including descriptions, items, links and metadata.

Data for the different feed types is normalized into a common set of columns.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query data using SQL.

For example:

```sql
select
  title,
  link,
  description
from
  rss_item
where
  feed_link = 'https://steampipe.io/blog/feed.xml';
```

```sh
+----------------+---------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| title          | link                      | description                            |

```hcl
connection "rss" {
  plugin = "rss"

  # Specify the default list of feed links for all the tables
  # Feed link must be provided either in where clause or should be configured as default feed links in the config file.
  # feed_links = ["https://steampipe.io/blog/feed.xml","https://www.podcastinsights.com/feed/"]
}
```

- `feed_links` - A list of default feed links. Feed link must be provided either in where clause or should be configured as default feed links in the config file.
